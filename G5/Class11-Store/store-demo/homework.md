## Homework: Tic Tac Toe Game Enhancements

### Requirements

Enhance the Tic Tac Toe game with the following features:

- **Play Against Bot:** Add the ability to play against a computer-controlled opponent ("the bot") with two difficulty levels:
  - **Easy Bot:** Makes random moves.
  - **Medium Bot:** Uses a smarter strategy to challenge the player.

### Game Flow

1. **Mode Selection:**  
    When the user opens the app, prompt them to choose a game mode:

   - Multiplayer (Player vs Player)
   - Easy Bot
   - Medium Bot

2. **Gameplay:**

   - **Multiplayer:**  
      Standard Tic Tac Toe gameplay between two human players. (As we did on class)
   - **Bot Modes:**  
      After the user makes a move, the bot should automatically make its move according to the selected difficulty.

3. **Bot Intelligence:**
   - The medium bot should be noticeably smarter than the easy bot.
