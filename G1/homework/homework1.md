# Homework 1 - Angular Basics & Lifecycle Hooks

## Overview

Create a simple Angular application that demonstrates your understanding of Angular syntax, data binding, lifecycle hooks, and signals. This homework will help you practice the concepts covered in the first two classes.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Initialize the Angular Application

```bash
# Create a new Angular project with standalone components and no routing (this is a shortcut)
ng new homework-app --standalone --routing=false --style=css

# Navigate to the project directory
cd homework-app

# Start the development server
npm run start
```

## Basic Requirements

### 1. Task Manager Component

Create a standalone component called `TaskManagerComponent` that allows users to manage their daily tasks.

**Requirements:**

- Users should be able to view all their current tasks
- Users should be able to add new tasks to their list
- Users should be able to mark tasks as completed
- The system should prevent adding empty tasks
- The system should track (log) when tasks are modified (added or completed)

## Bonus Requirements

### Enhanced Task Manager

- Allow users to clear all tasks at once
- Provide statistics about task completion status (e.g. how many tasks are completed, how many are pending)
